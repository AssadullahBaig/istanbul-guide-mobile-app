# 1. Introduction

The Istanbul Guide Mobile Application is a smart city exploration system designed to improve how tourists and residents explore Istanbul. The application will provide information about historical landmarks, museums, cultural venues, restaurants, transportation options, and local events.

The system will integrate GPS navigation, interactive maps, route optimization, and personalized recommendations. It will also support offline access and multilingual content. The goal is to create a focused, user-friendly, and intelligent digital guide specifically for Istanbul.

## 2.1 Google Maps

### Methods Used
- GPS-based navigation
- Route optimization algorithms
- Real-time traffic updates
- Location-based discovery
- User reviews and ratings
- AI-based personalization

### Technical Approach
Google Maps uses large-scale geospatial databases, cloud infrastructure, and routing engines. It integrates map rendering APIs with backend services that process location data and calculate routes.

### Feasibility for Our Project
City-level routing and POI listing are feasible using existing SDKs. However, global traffic prediction systems are outside the academic scope.

### Strengths
- Accurate navigation
- Real-time route updates
- Strong search functionality
- Intelligent recommendations

### Weaknesses
- Not focused on Istanbul specifically
- Limited cultural storytelling
- Overloaded interface

### Critical Aspects
- Dependence on external map APIs
- Complexity of real-time routing
- Data freshness is essential

## 2.2 TripAdvisor

### Methods Used
- User-generated reviews
- Ranking algorithms
- Category filtering
- Tourism-focused content presentation

### Technical Approach
TripAdvisor uses centralized databases for attractions and reviews, search indexing systems, and ranking logic based on ratings and user feedback.

### Feasibility for Our Project
A simplified review system and ranking mechanism can be implemented within the project scope.

### Strengths
- Strong tourism focus
- Community-based trust
- Rich place descriptions

### Weaknesses
- Weak route optimization
- Not offline-friendly
- Not city-specific

### Critical Aspects
- Review moderation challenges
- Risk of outdated information
- Ranking bias issues
